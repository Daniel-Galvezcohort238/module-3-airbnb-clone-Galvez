1. What does the `.map()` array method do?

It replaces each item in an array with the value returned from a function. INCORRECT

Returns a new array. Whatever gets returned from the callback
function provided is placed at the same index in the new array.
Usually we take the items from the original array and modify them
in some way.


2. What do we usually use `.map()` for in React?

We usually use .map to move data into elements and props


3. Why is using `.map()` better than just creating the components
   manually by typing them out?

   It makes it more reusable and automatic, since real life websites dont have people hard-coding data into elements everytime they need to add something to the website.
