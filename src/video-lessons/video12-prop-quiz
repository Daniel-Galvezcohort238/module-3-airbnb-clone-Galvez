1. What do props help us accomplish?
making components reusable


2. How do you pass a prop into a component?
by calliing the component, creating a prop and giving it a value, and lastly accepting props in your component's parameters.

function Navbar(props) {
    return (
        <header>
            {props.prop}
        </header>
    )
}
